### How DET started
![Alt](/assets/img/aboutus/email-screenshot.jpeg "An email written by Xinran in 2017")
> "It was 2017. I was a junior in college. I loved working with RDBMS and SQL during my internship. I wanted to become a data engineer. But I didn't know how.
> 
> There weren’t many books or online resources about data engineering. I didn’t know data engineers who I could talk to. I felt alone and lost.
>
> I was lucky enough to find a mentor, Donald Sawyer, who showed me the way of data engineering and helped me navigate my career. But I know few got a mentorship like this.
>
> Today, I see more and more people want to build a career in data engineering and many are just as lost as I was. And I know that feeling so well.
>
> That’s why I started Data Engineering Things! **I want us to have a community where we feel safe to say “I don’t know”, ask questions, and learn from each other.**"
